Assertion
=========

An assertion model that uses boolean expressions.

As a developer it allows you to build a chain of assertions to be executed as preconditions in order to avoid breaking an object invariants.
It provides a nice and legible way to write guards, a mechanism by using pure objects instead of flow control structures suck as the IF syntax.

Usage sample
============

The EmailAddress and EmailAddressTestCase classes in the test package show how to write elegant preconditions.
